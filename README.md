# Evently
A Mineclub-style admin event system I created for a Minecraft server I used to work at called NebulaMC. Now disused, so I've open-sourced it lest anyone wants to use it.

### Requirements
- ExcellentCrates (although this is probably best to be removed in most cases, this was specific to NebulaMC)
- LuckPerms
- EssentialsX

### Why Evently?
It just sounded kind of cool. The name never got shown to the public so it was just a little easter egg for me and the dev team.
